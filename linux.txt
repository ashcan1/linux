A shell is what's known as an interpreter. Similar to a compiler,
 an interpreter translates the human code into machine code.
One of the differences is that an interpreter does this one statement at a time. Meanwhile,
a compiler scans the entire program and translates it all into machine code.


What are the different layers of Linux?

Hardware layer − Hardware consists of all peripheral devices (RAM/ HDD/ CPU etc).

Kernel − It is the core component of Operating System, interacts directly with hardware, provides low level services to upper layer components.

Shell − An interface to kernel, hiding complexity of kernel's functions from users. The shell takes commands from the user and executes kernel's functions.

Utilities − Utility programs that provide the user most of the functionalities of an operating systems.



Explain briefly about three popular Linux shells?


Bash
Bash, or the Bourne-Again Shell, is by far the most widely used choice and it comes installed as the default shell in the most popular Linux distributions. 
It was developed from the original UNIX Bourne shell (also known as sh) and was designed to be fully compatible with the old scripts, while adding multiple improved features.

Bash is a very solid shell option, since it has been used for a long time and there is ample documentation for it. In fact, most online tutorials will assume that you’re using bash.

As a result, it is recommended for most users and works great for most common system administration tasks.
 However, if you need more powerful scripting options or other advanced tools,
  it is time to explore some of the newer shells available


Zsh
Zsh or the Z-shell was designed from the onset to be interactive and incorporate some of the best features of older shells.
 It provides unique scripting features, it is highly customizable and is easy to use,
  with spelling correction, command completion or filename globbing.

Installation on CentOS is very easy, with a single command:

yum install zsh
You can now launch the new shell, with the zsh command, you’ll notice a small change in the way the prompt looks:

Keep in mind that you should configure zsh before using it in order to benefit from its most powerful features. 
Several open-source frameworks,
 such as oh-my-zsh, are available for even more customization options and plugins.
